## Project Summary: E-commerce Sales Analysis

This project analyzed an e-commerce dataset to generate business insights through a step-by-step process.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Initial data cleaning involved handling missing 'CustomerID' values and converting 'InvoiceDate' to datetime objects. Rows with non-positive quantities or unit prices were removed, resulting in a clean dataset for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA revealed fluctuating monthly sales trends and identified top-selling products by both quantity and revenue. Customer purchase frequency and average order value were calculated, highlighting the United Kingdom as having the most unique customers. Sales distribution across countries (excluding the UK) was also visualized.

**Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis):** Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values were calculated for each customer. Customers were segmented based on these values, and the distribution and average RFM scores for each segment were analyzed to understand customer behavior patterns.

**Cohort Analysis:** Cohort analysis was performed to examine customer retention over time based on their first purchase month. A heatmap visualized the retention matrix, showing that retention rates generally decrease across cohorts over time.

**Product Analysis:** Product analysis focused on identifying popular products and their performance. Top products by revenue were highlighted, and product performance metrics like average price and total quantity sold were calculated.

**Key Insights:** The analysis provided insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The RFM and cohort analysis offer valuable information for targeted marketing and retention strategies. Further investigation into sales seasonality and product associations could yield additional actionable insights.
